# Coda-C_PList

## The Coda-C Property List Library

This library provides a classed system of objects that model the Apple Propery List or 'plist'.
A plist is any one of the supported objects, but is most often a Dictionary.
Plists are easy to create and modify programmatically, and even easier to save and load from disk.

## Features:

* Supports XML serialization in 'plist' or 'codalist' formats
* Native C object types.
* Provides container manipulation for Array and Dictionary
* Retain counted objects simplify changes to plists
* Plugin support for Binary Property List serialization with a compatable library
* A pure C source and API for increased portablity
